# Brain Tumor Classification Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to classify brain tumors from medical images. The notebook demonstrates loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluating models for this task.

## Project Overview

The project aims to:
- Load and preprocess medical imaging data (e.g., MRI scans).
- Build and train machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

## Workflow

The notebook covers:
1. **Data Loading**
   - Loading medical image datasets.
   - Handling labels and metadata.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation (if applicable).

3. **Model Training**
   - Training a classifier (e.g., CNN or other ML models) on the dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion matrix
   - Other relevant metrics

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
